A Defective Celeste Classic & PICO-8 Port to Python 3

- Main script is "cpyleste.py"

- Dependencies are listed in "requirements.txt" and can be installed via pip like so:
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

    Note: If Numba is giving you problems, remove the decorators and
    numba imports from all areas of the source code

- Requires Python 3.7 or newer

Some other notes about the port:
  When dying for the first time, you will experience an abrupt
  lag spike for just a little bit, this is because the death particles
  class is being JIT'd for the first time when that occurs.
  Every time after that, it should be silky smooth.
  (Same goes with the particles from the big chest)

Uses my Hagia "engine" which pretends to be the PICO-8 sort of.
